  <p>why?</p>
  <p>why did you click the link?</p>
  <p>i said just click it when it feels right</p>
  <p>sorry i made a jab at you</p>
  <p>like you didnt take one at me first</p>
  <p>everything is just going downhill lately. and by lately i think its been forever</p>
  <p>the websites not broken. i just hadent set it up yet. ive barely read the response </p>
  <p>im just shaking</p>
  <p>how can i shake after its been so long</p>
  <p>its not your fault im broken you just seem to be a part of it to me</p>
  <p>who are you??</p>
  <p>i know ive lost myself but so have you</p>
  <p>what part of feels right means right now??? guess that shows me how delusional i am</p>
  <p><strong>3.15</strong></p>
  <p>im actually so delusional that I think that the response you gave me...</p>
  <p>is a front. just to pretend that the site doesn't work in case anyone reads it. but you'll save the link.</p>
  <p>hopefully. you definitely clicked it once. and it really didn't have anything. but youll see this eventually</p>
  <p>3.30</p>
  <p>i really am sorry</p>
  <p>I think I have a couple personality disorders that have really been affecting me lately</p>
  <p>oh and im an adict ofc. oh well. let's see where this stupid ass diary goes</p>
