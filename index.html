  <p>why?</p>
  <p>why did you click the link?</p>
  <p>i said just click it when it feels right</p>
  <p>sorry i made a jab at you</p>
  <p>like you didnt take one at me first</p>
  <p>everything is just going downhill lately. and by lately i think its been forever</p>
  <p>the websites not broken. i just hadent set it up yet. ive barely read the response </p>
  <p>im just shaking</p>
  <p>how can i shake after its been so long</p>
  <p>its not your fault im broken you just seem to be a part of it to me</p>
  <p>who are you??</p>
  <p>i know ive lost myself but so have you</p>
  <p>what part of feels right means right now??? guess that shows me how delusional i am</p>
  <p><strong>3.15</strong></p>
  <p>im actually so delusional that I think that the response you gave me...</p>
  <p>is a front. just to pretend that the site doesn't work in case anyone reads it. but you'll save the link.</p>
  <p>hopefully. you definitely clicked it once. and it really didn't have anything. but youll see this eventually</p>
  <p>3.30</p>
  <p>i really am sorry</p>
  <p>I think I have a couple personality disorders that have really been affecting me lately</p>
  <p>oh and im an adict ofc. oh well. let's see where this stupid ass diary goes</p>
  <p>1.27</p>

   <p>hey. sorry it's been a minute.</p>
   <p>I had a lot that I wanted to get into tonight. but ig its all good now</p>
   <p>that's okay. I'm blissful rn. that's probably why I'm thinking of you.</p>
   <p>even though I talked a lot of shots about you tn... sorry...</p>
   <p>I guess I'll take it easy. I got a new phone. I got the fold 5, and lord.... it might have cured my depression for a while.</p>
   <p>anyways. hopefully I'll update yall tomorrow. I probably won't since I've been drinking (day drinking too) for like 2 weeks.</p>
   <p>maybe that's why I've been doing okay. amaru will help me. you don't know them yet but yall will love amaru.</p>
   <p>hopefully i update this shit to look nicer too. soo i can have a dopdown to hide that ugly ass first entry.</p>
   <p>that thing was a mess but i was going thru it. ig i always am. bc i always use that as an excuse. anyways. i hope ill be okay. widepepohappy</p>

   <p>i never understood a lot of things.</p>

   <p>I think I've been alone for a lot longer than I knew</p>
   <p>I really miss you... and J.</p>
   <p>at least I made one improvement, I'm not absolutely sauced while typing this. unlike whatever the he'll else I put on here</p>
